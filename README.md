# Team Webb Presentation

The script is available in both the Jupyter notebook file and in the HTML file. Included are all data sets required to run the script. 

GitHub has not rendered the markdown cells with the titles in the Jupyter file so the HTML file presents the file as intended. The Jupyter file does however include all the code. 

In this project, we were given a data set of daily exchange rates from Kaggle, and had to conduct our own research into possible reasons for the USD's appreciation during the 2007-08 Financial Crisis. In a short time span of a few weeks, we sourced the rest of the data from different sources (IMF, World Bank) and ran a multivariate linear regression to test for alternative hypotheses. 

I was primarily responsible for a large portion of the data wrangling, visualisations and linear regression.
